Jenga:
    1. shoot the blocks out of place instead of grabbing with hands
    2. different colored blocks will do different things (regular colors: wood-textured)
        * Jon (Cyan): I would like to have my color blocks cause the next person's pointer to sway left and right on the screen (forcing them to perfectly time their shot)
        * Stuart (yellow): Destroy other bricks after a while
        * Andrew (red):shoot one red have to take out any other red one.
