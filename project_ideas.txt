Jenga:
    1. shoot the blocks out of place instead of grabbing with hands
    2. different colored blocks will do different things (colors: red, green, blue)
        * For myself, I would like to have my color blocks cause the next person's pointer to sway left and right on the screen (forcing them to perfectly time their shot)
    3. lower blocks may require multiple shots to be taken out
